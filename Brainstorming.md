## Top 3 New App Ideas
1. Plant Lover
2. Virtual Closet
3. Palestine Support (tied with 2)
*NOTE:* I like the icon creator idea, but I don't believe I have enough time to find an Icon generative AI in time for this course (IOS101). That will be a long term effort! 

## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Plant-Sitter
   - **Description**: Allow plant owners to keep track of when to feed their plant, if they need to repot, and if they need to change the location of their plant. New plant owners can do a test to discover what kind of plant is the right plant for them based off of their location, weather, season, and schedule.
   - **Category:** Lifestyle
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is important for logging plant updates and health statistics. Compass/location will be used to recommend best plant to have and where in your household.
   - **Story:** Creates an informed guide for beginner plant owners or plant owners transitioning to take care of it the best way they can, while also adjusting to their schedule to make a plant experience feel less like a "chore", while simultaneously educating. Allows experienced plant users with busy schedules to relax and plan ahead for their plants.
   - **Market:** Any person who wants to have a house plant, or is an experienced but busy plant owner can use this app. Could be further implemented for crops such as berries and vegetables.
   - **Habit:** Experienced plant owners are using it at least weekly to cross of tasks involving their plant. Inexperienced plant owners can use it daily for advice and more information on their plant, making it a bridgeway for those inexperienced to learn more with less failure and more support.
   - **Scope:** V1 would test compass and plant recommendation test, which could be tested via experienced plant owners for the compass, and beginners that may already have the plant they got tested for. V2 would have the task creator and calendar for users to input their schedule for watering the plant. V3 would set up a way for beginner users to automatically have a schedule for their plant. Could also implement advice/"diagnoses" for users in case there is an issue with their plant, with video guidance and linked articles.

1. Watermelon (Support Palestine)
   - **Description**: Resources to support Palestine, including companies, GoFundMe's, and resources to break down information
   - **Category:** Lifestyle, Advocacy
   - **Mobile:** Mobile used for quick logging and convenience; possibility to make events to bring users together
   - **Story:** For users finding it difficult to support Palestine from the safety of their home, with doubts of others' purpose asking for money claiming it's for Palestine
   - **Market:** Any person who wants to support Palestine. Can either use the resources to protest, or post GoFundMe's (will have to be verified)
   - **Habit:** Users can use it every time they go out and interact with corporations, including grocery stores and resturants to know more about their history with the situation.
   - **Scope:** V1 would have an API that shows the location of Pro-Palestine stores/resturants near them, as well as GoFundMe's providing their story with proof of where their donations is going to. V2 would implement a fact-check section, debunking common misconceptions, as well as verification for users to make events on the app. V3 could expand with more social justic issues, such as climate change, which would use the map feature and Google Maps API to find the best route for less carbon emissions, with the GoFundMe's being towards nonprofits/startups/companies making an active change towards improving it, while providing evidence of other companies not taking any action at all. Further versions could then implement other large social justice topics, and could then become a more generalized app.
